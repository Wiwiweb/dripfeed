# dripfeed
Webcomic archive RSS feed creator

Ever found a new webcomic that seemed interesting, but it already has thousands of pages and you don't want to binge read for weeks?  
Dripfeed will let you follow webcomics archives as if they are currently ongoing, via RSS feeds.

### Dev plan:
1. Create node-js app that returns rss feeds from a URL but with bogus info
2. Add database integration, but with manually entered db info
3. Create python script that scrapes webcomic pages and feeds into the db
4. Create barebones home page
5. Beautify home page
